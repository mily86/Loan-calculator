This assignment gave me practical experience with building a functional Flutter application. I learned how to navigate between screens, manage app state, and structure a responsive user interface. Besides, I'm also learned implementing user input handling, form validation, and calculation logic in a stateful widget.It helped me to understand how Flutter manages interaction and state changes. Overall, the project strengthened my understanding of Flutter's widget tree, lifecycle methods, and UI design principles.
