This assigement helped me to understand several Flutter concepts:

- Navigating between screens using Navigator and pushReplacement

- Managing app lifecycle with initState and Future.delayed for splash timing

- Building responsive layouts with Column, Center, and Padding

- Using Image.asset to display images from assets

- Handling user input with TextEditingController and validation

- Implementing dropdown menus and calculation logic in a stateful widget
